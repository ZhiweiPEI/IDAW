<h3>Football</h3><hr/>
<p>One of my favorite activities is football. Since 2006, I've been a football fan because of the World Cup, and very quickly I fell in love with one of the greatest football clubs -- Real Madrid because of Zidane and Beckham.
When I was a little boy, I was dreaming about becoming a football star but somehow I now become a future engineer... Anyway, I started playing football when I was at junior high school and during the past decade, I've taken part in many matches and scored a plenty of points and of course won a lot of titles.
Following are some pictures in the match</p>

<h3>Photography</h3><hr/>
<p>Another favorite hobby of mine is photographing, I'm proud of saying that I'm a amateur photographer. When you have a camera, you will never be satisfied with your phone anymore. I started this hobby when I was graduated from my college.
At that time, all of a sudden, I got a lot of free time to kill, so I took a long time traveling around China and kept every meaningful moment with my camera.
Not only landscapes, city views, but also emotions from humans. Through every picture I took, I feel that I can go back to these happy days. Also, I like to appreciate my own masterpiece, too!!!
Let me show you some of my beautiful work</p>
